# House Points Program - README

## Overview
The **House Points Program** is a web-based application designed for an all-girls middle school to track house points. This app provides:

1. A **House Leaderboard** showcasing the total points for each house, dynamically ranked.
2. A **Student Leaderboard** displaying the top 25 students based on individual points.
3. A **House Roster Section**, where each house has its own card displaying student names and buttons for incrementing and decrementing individual points.

The application is styled to align with the school's brand colors:
- **Marian Blue**: #20438d
- **Light Blue**: #4d9ad4

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a responsive and interactive layout for ease of use.

## Features
### Current Functionality
- **Dynamic Leaderboards**: The House and Student Leaderboards are dynamically populated and ranked based on the given data.
- **House Cards**: Each house has its own section displaying:
  - House name.
  - List of students.
  - Buttons for adjusting points for each student (currently non-functional).
- **Styling**: The app is styled with custom colors and fonts, using the school's branding.

### Next Steps
To enhance the functionality, the following features are planned:

1. **House Points Totals**:
   - Add a total points section to each house card, updating as student points change.

2. **Excel Save-Off**:
   - Add a feature to export the current points data as an Excel file for quarterly reporting.

3. **Data Upload Tool**:
   - Create an upload feature to allow administrators to load data from Excel, enabling efficient updates to rosters and scores.

4. **Add a reset button**:
   -Add a reset button with passowrd authorization.

5. **Require passcode**:
   -Require a passcode to access the site. 

## How to Run
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. View the dynamically populated leaderboards and rosters.
3. Use the interface for visual exploration of house and student points (functional interactivity pending).

## Future Considerations
- **Authentication**: Add login credentials to ensure only authorized users can modify points.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Refine the layout to better support smaller devices.
- **Historical Tracking**: Implement a history log to track changes to points for auditing purposes.
